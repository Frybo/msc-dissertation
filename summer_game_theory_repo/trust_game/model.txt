Game model so far:
	Investor plays trustee, investor takes the first turn. Chooses a = 0 or 1.
	Investor gives a to Agent 2, keeping 1 - a for themselves.
	Trustee receives b*a, and returns 0 <= f(a) <= b*a to investor, keeping
	b*a - f(a) for themselves.
	Agent 1 then receives c*f(a), leaving them with a total of 1 - a + c*f(a).

I want to iterate this game over a random number of turns. Players will not 
switch positions between each turn.

With this model in mind, I need to consider how the agents will decide on the
proportions to give. The first gift on the first round will obviously be
predecided. Every gift after that could potentially depend on the history of
gifts from the other agent.
