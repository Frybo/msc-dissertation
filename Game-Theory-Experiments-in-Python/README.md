Game-Theory-Experiments-in-Python
=================================

Simulations created in my free time. Demonstrates famous games of game theory, with formatted output. The output can be used for demonstrating hard to understand concepts, such as the unequal chances of the Monty Hall problem.

Simulations
-----------

Every simulation has a detailed documentation in its folder explaining the background, the script and the output. The following list is a summary.

### Prisoner's Dilemma

I have implemented the prisoner dilemma simulation with a genetic algorithm. Every player is matched with every other player from its generation. The goal of the players is to get the least possible years in prison.

### Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a fine example of a case where our intuition may lead us in the wrong direction. The player choses a door out of the three. The host removes one and offers the player the chance to switch to the other closed door. The chance of victory is 33.3% if the player stays with the door and 66.6% if they switch doors.

### El Farol Bar Problem

In the El Farol problem players have to decide if they are going to the El Farol Bar that night. The challenge is to go to the bar when it isn't overcrowded and avoid the bar when it is.
